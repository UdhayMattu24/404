        <h1>What is Plastic?</h1>
        <p> 
            Plastic is a synthetic material made from polymers,<br>
            primarily derived from petrochemicals, <br>
            Known for its versatility, durability, <br>
            and lightweight nature, plastic is used widely in packaging, <br>
            consumer goods, construction, and many other industries, <br>
            It has become a ubiquitous part of modern life, <br>
            but its resilience and slow degradation rate contribute to environmental pollution. <br>

        <h1> What is Recycling?</h1>
        <p>
             Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into reusable materials. <br>
            This reduces the need for new raw materials, conserves energy, <br>
            and mitigates pollution by reducing waste sent to landfills or oceans, <br>
            Recycling helps manage resources sustainably, creating a circular economy. <br>

        <h1>What is Plastic Recycling?</h1>
        <p> Plastic recycling involves collecting, sorting, <br> 
            processing, and remanufacturing used plastic products into new materials, <br>
            Since plastic is not biodegradable, recycling it reduces environmental damage , <br>
            The process can vary based on the type of plastic, <br>
            as different plastics have different properties and recycling capabilities. <br>

        <h1>What is the Biggest Issue Stopping the Recycling of Plastics?</h1>
        <p> One of the biggest issues hindering plastic recycling is contamination, <br>
            When plastics are contaminated with food residues, mixed with non-recyclable materials, <br>
            or improperly sorted, they become harder and more costly to recycle, <br>
            Contaminated plastics often end up in landfills or <br>
            incinerators rather than being recycled into new products. <br>

        <h1>What is the Estimated Growth of the Plastic Recycling Market?</h1>
        <p> The plastic recycling market has been projected to grow significantly, <br>
            driven by the rising demand for sustainable practices, <br>
            Some estimates indicate an annual growth rate of around 6% to 8% for the  <br>
            plastic recycling market, with the market expected to reach a
            multi-billion dollar valuation over the next decade. <br>
